		<h2><tb> Now this is a story all about how<br>
		My life got flip turned upside down<br>
		And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there<br>
		I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air<br>
		In West Philadelphia born and raised<br> 
		On a playground where I spent most of my days<br>
		Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br>
		And shootin some b-ball outside of the school<br>
		When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br>
		Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br>
		I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br>
		She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'<br> 
		I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br>
 		The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror<br>
 		If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br>
 		But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, home to Bel Air'<br>
 		I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br>
		And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo home smell ya later'<br>
 		I looked at my kingdom<br>
 		I was finally there<br>
 		To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air<br></h2>
